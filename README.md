# s33-pyscraps
Collection of short hacky python scripts I write for whatever I feel the need to script. I doubt they're that readable, and I seriously doubt anyone else will find them useful.

the vapetools subdirectory contains random utilities I have around to quickly calculate ingredient proportions for my eJuices, and other miscellaneous electronic cigarette stuff. Don't expect anything remotely polished, but if you can read my haphazardly written code, go nuts!

I'll add more as time goes on, but again, this is more of a scratch pad for random snippets of code rather than a cohesive project. 

Sorry in advance for the code horror that may inevitably pop up here!
